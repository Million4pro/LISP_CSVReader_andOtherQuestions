1) One of my biggest achievements was during my time at Nethealth our team was assigned to a very critical project, 
the main goal of the project was to make our application meet standards and be certified by a government agency. 
For this reason, the application must incorporate some required changes. 
We worked as a team in a collaborative way day and off office hours and were able to finish the project before the deadline. 
And later we managed to get the required certification.

2) Recently I was researching about azure DevOps portal in order to improve my knowledge of different services that Azure can provide Including Azure Service bus, 
App Services, and Azure Cosmos DB. As a developer, I strongly recommend researching services and technologies that Azure and 
other cloud computing services can provide and we should always try to think about how we can improve our process and product using these services.
